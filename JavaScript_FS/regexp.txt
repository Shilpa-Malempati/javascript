Regular expressions may have flags that affect the search.

There are only 6 of them in JavaScript:

i===========With this flag the search is case-insensitive: no difference 
                       between A and a (see the example below).

g===========With this flag the search looks for all matches, 
                        without it – only the first match is returned.

m===========Multiline mode 

s===========Enables “dotall” mode, that allows a dot . to match newline character \n 

u===========Enables full unicode support. The flag enables correct processing of surrogate pairs.

y===========“Sticky” mode: searching at the exact position in the text .










Callbacks:

A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing,hence 
the name 'call back'.
the function that is passed as an argument is called a callback functions.
these functions are called higher order functions.
it is helpful in events.



Recursion:

A recursive function is a function that calls itself. And this technique is called recursion.
